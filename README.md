MEDICAL INSURANCE COST PROJECT

Company Overview üè≠

The project revolves around a Hospital ABC, a leading healthcare provider, aims to optimize its resource allocation and improve patient care by understanding the factors influencing medical costs for its patients. The company has identified a significant relationship between demographic factors, lifestyle-related information and health status with medical costs. Additionally the project will provide actionable insights for Hospital ABC to improve resource allocation, healthcare planning, and patient support services, ultimately enhancing the quality and accessibility of healthcare services for its patients.

Data Overview üìäüîç

The dataset includes information about patients demographics, lifestyle, health status and medical expenses. The dataset includes attributes such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, region, as well as additional information like occupation, exercise frequency, chronic conditions, and more.

Problem: Investigate the impact of insurance plan type, income level, and family medical history on healthcare expenses.

Goal: Develop a predictive model to estimate medical costs for individual patients based on the collected features.

Problem Solving Approach

1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset, identify patterns, and gain insights into the business.

2.Data Cleaning: Address missing values, drop unnecessary columns, and prepare the data for analysis.

3.Data Visualization: Create visualizations to understand the distribution, relationships, and trends in the data.

4.Feature Engineering: Enhance the dataset by creating new features or modifying existing ones.

5.Correlation Analysis: Investigate the relationships between variables to understand their impact on the target variable.

6.Data Preprocessing: Encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and prepare the data for modeling.

7.Model Building: Implement multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the charges.

8.Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

9.Model Comparison: Identify the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
